## 🌟 Overview

Eco was created with the goal of helping people connect with local communities and happenings — from open mic nights and pop-up markets to spontaneous meetups and campus events.

We wanted it to feel alive and hyper-local. Unlike general-purpose event platforms, Eco focuses on immediacy, proximity, and simplicity.

## 🚫 Why No Code?

The core app and backend involve sensitive authentication logic and Firestore rules that are tightly scoped to production environments. To protect users and backend integrity, the source code is private.

This repo exists to document and showcase the app's architecture, design, and impact.
