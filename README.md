## 🌟 Overview

Eco was created with the goal of helping people connect with local communities and happenings — from open mic nights and pop-up markets to spontaneous meetups and campus events.

We wanted it to feel alive and hyper-local. Unlike general-purpose event platforms, Eco focuses on immediacy, proximity, and simplicity.
